# Engineering design

Could you additionally add an engineering-design.md file, 
where you discuss a bit lower level (code) on how the commands flow through the code. 
Only discuss the public methods of classes -never private ones. 
It's important to also detail any external resources 
(i.e. the filesystem in our current implementation) that we use.
